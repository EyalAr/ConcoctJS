# ConcoctJS
A content compiler on Node.js

ConcoctJS knows to take templates, compile them in some context and write the results to disk. Anything in the middle is up to plugins.

I use ConcoctJS, with some additional plugins, to generate my static blogs. You can use it for whatever you want.

ConcoctJS works with any templating engine, as long as there is a plugin to handle it.
The contexts on which templates are compiled are also generated by plugins.

ConcoctsJS workflow is simple:
1. Read templates.
2. Run plugins.
3. Write compiled templates.
